				The History of HvH
				<h6> HvH has </h6>
				<p class="extraWidth"> been around since Counter-Strike: Source, however it wasn't very popularized until late 2016 - 2017. I started playing the gamemode in late 2017.
				This gamemode was created by people who were bored of the standard game. This allows cheaters to play with each other rather than ruining legit player's games. HvH has 
				allowed me to meet a lot of friends and caused me to be involved in some drama due to the toxic community that is involved with it. I have had personal information leaked 
				over people getting mad at a video game. However, it's very rare for these things to happen. This can happen on other games just as much as this gamemode, it's just that this 
				gamemode has a lot of toxicity around it which causes players to believe people are harmful when they really aren't. There is something called Anti-aim, which has changed drastically over the years.
				Fake-Angles were a big part of HvH that eventually got patched in December of 2018. We now have something called Desync. People always talk about how Desync is so much worse than Fake-Angles.</p>
