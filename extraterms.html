				Terminology
				<h6>Fake-lag</h6>
				<p class="extraWidth">Fake-lag is a core feature that allows you to essentially look laggy to other players. This can cause a cheat with a bad prediction system to not be able to shoot at the right position 
				and can cause you to desync your playermodel. Fake-lag should be randomized to have a less of a chance of being predicted. You can choke up to 14 packets reliably before having issues arise.</p>
				<br>
				<h6>Fake-lag prediction</h6>
				<p class="extraWidth">Fake-lag prediction is a feature that should automatically be turned on in most cheats. This allows you to attempt to predict where the player-model of an enemy actually is before attempting to shoot. 
				If a player attempts to break lag-comp, it will cause them to look jittery and will cause you to miss due to prediction and shoot at invalid lag-records. This should all be fixed by using a good prediction system.</p>
				<br>
				<h6>Anti-Aim</h6>
				<p class="extraWidth">Anti-Aim and Desync go hand in hand together. Desync allows you to create a 60 degree fake, however Anti-Aim allows you to change your pitch and yaw. So you can be looking around normally however the server will see
				 you where you put your pitch and yaw to. The best place is to have your head backwards and down. If you use down pitch it allows your fake to extend out further to prevent a safe-point from being created on your head. Backwards allows 
				 you to hide your head better so even if they do have you resolved they might not be able to hit it due to the positioning you are in.</p>
